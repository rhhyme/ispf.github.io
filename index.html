            ASD
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental condition
            that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn,
            and behave. It's called a "spectrum" disorder because it affects
            individuals differently and to varying degrees. The term encompasses
            a wide range of characteristics and levels of support needed. While
            the specific presentation of ASD varies greatly from person to
            person, there are some symptoms, particularly in young children,
            that people might more easily recognize such as social
            communication/interaction differences and repetitive or restricted
            behaviors or interests. However, a diagnosis of ASD requires a
            comprehensive evaluation by qualified professionals.

            ADHD

          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a
            neuro-developmental condition characterized by persistent patterns
            of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with
            functioning or development. These patterns are more frequent and
            severe than is typical for individuals at a comparable level of
            development. It's important to remember that everyone occasionally
            experiences difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, or
            impulsivity. However, in ADHD, these symptoms are chronic, pervasive
            (occurring in multiple settings like home, school, or work), and
            significantly impact daily life. Again, a comprehensive evaluation
            by a qualified healthcare professional is necessary to diagnose
            ADHD.

            Dyslexia
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neuro-biological
            in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or
            fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.
            These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the
            phonological component of language that is often unexpected in
            relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective
            classroom instruction. Essentially, dyslexia is a language-based
            learning disability that primarily affects reading. It's not about
            intelligence; people with dyslexia have a range of intellectual
            abilities. The core difficulty lies in processing the sounds of
            language (phonemes) and how they relate to written letters
            (graphemes).

            Tourette Syndrome
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Tourette Syndrome is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by
            tics, which are sudden, repetitive, non-rhythmic movements or
            vocalizations. These tics are involuntary, meaning the person cannot
            easily control them. To be diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, a
            person must have both multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic
            at some point, although not necessarily at the same time. Tourette
            Syndrome is a complex condition, and its impact varies greatly from
            person to person. With understanding, support, and appropriate
            management strategies, individuals with TS can lead full and
            productive lives.

          Synesthesia, and other conditions. We only take four most common
          examples that people might associate those to Neurodiversity. It is
          important to note that Neurodiversity is not the same as Intellectual
          Disability. Neurodivergent Individual may very well be an intelligent
          person who has regular or high Intelligent Quotient (IQ).

            Understand
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Understanding neurodivergent individuals goes beyond simply
            acknowledging their differences. It requires a genuine effort to
            learn about their unique ways of thinking, processing information,
            and experiencing the world. Take the initiative to learn about
            different neurodivergent conditions (autism, ADHD, dyslexia,
            dyspraxia, Tourette's, etc.) and the diverse ways they can manifest.
            Be aware that each individual within a neurodivergent group is still
            unique. Understand that neurodivergence often comes with unique
            strengths and talents. Focus on identifying and appreciating these
            abilities rather than solely focusing on perceived deficits.There is
            no single "right" way to be. Embrace the diversity of human
            neurobiology and respect each individual's unique way of navigating
            the world.

            Support
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Providing support means creating environments and systems that are
            inclusive, accessible, and tailored to the needs of neurodivergent
            individuals. Be willing to make reasonable adjustments in various
            settings (educational, workplace, social) to support their needs.
            This might include providing quiet workspaces, visual aids, flexible
            deadlines, clear instructions, or alternative communication methods.
            Connect individuals with resources and tools that can help them
            thrive, such as assistive technologies, support groups, therapists
            specializing in neurodivergence, and educational materials. Actively
            work to remove barriers that might prevent neurodivergent
            individuals from accessing education, employment, social activities,
            and other opportunities.

            Empower
          </h5>
          <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            It goes beyond general support and involves more active and
            personalized assistance to enable neurodivergent individuals to
            achieve their goals and participate fully in society. Create
            opportunities where their neurodivergent traits can be an asset.
            Empower neurodivergent individuals to understand their own needs and
            advocate for themselves effectively. Provide them with the tools and
            knowledge to do so. Acknowledge and celebrate their achievements, no
            matter how small they may seem. This reinforces positive growth and
            encourages continued progress.
